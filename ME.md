I'm a 17 years old student from Norway who loves to hack around with Ruby and
has a part-time job in Scandinavian Design Group.

My first encounter with Ruby was, unsurpisingly, Rails. While I certainly liked
the principles of Rails, I didn't knew the Ruby language at that time. Instead
of actually learning Ruby, I rather started looking for Rails-clones in PHP. I
must have tried them all, but there was always *something* that didn't seem
quite right with them.

A few months later I discovered _why's interactive Try Ruby! and from that
moment I realised what all of those clones lacked: Ruby. I also realised that
Ruby was way more interesting than Rails.

Right now I'm working a few interesting projects:

* I'm the current maintainer of [Camping](camp)
* I'm trying to make better template engines through [Temple](temple) ...
* ... which invloves rewriting Haml to use Temple (coming soon)
* ... and implementing a mockup-driven template engine (coming soon)
* ... and improving Liquid's performance (coming soon)
* I've also been thinking a lot about a unified Ruby AST (coming soon)

Basically I have tons of ideas, but too little time finishing them all. By
applying to Ruby Sommer of Code I can finally get one idea out of my mind and
justify using quite a few hours on it.
